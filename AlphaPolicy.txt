
1. Introduction 
This document sets out Alpha Data IT policy towards taking backups of its information assets, including 
their frequency, storage, retention, documentation and restoration. 
2. Scope 
This policy applies to all users of information assets including 'IT employees, employees of Cloud Team, 
vendors, business partners, and contractor personnel regardless of geographic locations. 
This Policy covers all Information Systems (IS) environments operated by 'Alpha Data IT & Cloud Infrastructure' or contracted with a third party by 'Alpha Data Network Services’. The term “IS environment” defines the total environment and includes, but is not limited to, all documentation, physical and logical controls, personnel, hardware (e.g. mainframe, distributed, desktop, network devices, telecommunication elements and wireless devices), software, and information. 
Although this Policy explicitly covers the responsibilities of users, it does not cover the matter 
exclusively. Other 'Alpha Data' Information Security policies, standards, and procedures define 
additional responsibilities.
 All users are required to read, understand and comply with the otherInformation Security policies, standards, and procedures. If any user does not fully understand anything in these documents, he should consult with his systems administrator, business or functional manager, or Security team. 
3. Policy Statements 
This policy addresses the back-up of the information assets of Alpha Data IT & Cloud assets. 
3.1.General Backup Policy Statements 
• Back up of essential business information and software should be taken according to a 
comprehensive schedule. 
• Adequate back-up facilities should be provided to ensure that all essential business 
information and software could be recovered following a disaster or media failure. 
• Back-up arrangements for individual systems and related data should be tested according 
to a formal schedule to ensure that they meet the requirements of business continuity 
plans 
3.2.Backup and Restoration 
• All applications, operating systems, data (including databases), user configuration 
information and hardware configuration information where applicable) must be backed 
up in accordance with the Backup and Restoration Procedure. 
• Separate systems specific backup and restoration procedures must be developed in 
accordance with system requirements and vendor recommendations. These procedures 
must be documented and implemented during (and as part of) system implementation. 
5 | Page Internal Use Version 1 . 0
Description 
The Backup and Restoration Procedure will determine the type of backups to be performed, the 
periodicity or schedule of the backup, the protection to be provided to backup media based on 
the criticality of the information backed up as determined by 'Alpha Data’s’ Asset Classification 
and Control document. 
• Restoration of backups will require specific and appropriate authorization and must be 
performed in accordance with the Backup and Restoration Procedure. 
• Systems Administrators shall perform a verification process on the backup data to make 
sure that it is backed up successfully. 
• Systems Administrators shall perform a backup before and after installing batches or 
upgrades or making any configuration changes on the system. 
Description 
This may be achieved using a combination of image copies, incremental backups, differential 
backups, transaction logs, or other techniques. 
? Backed up data that is confidential must be stored in encrypted form. 
3.3.Testing of Backup Media 
• Systems Administrators must check the quality of the backup media (tapes, floppy 
diskettes, CDs, etc.) regularly and make sure that they are in a good condition to be 
reused. 
• After completion of backup testing, all data must be safely erased from the test 
environment. 
3.4.Testing of Restoration Procedures 
• The System Administrator is to be responsible for testing system software and data 
backups by restoring a sample of the backups according to a formal schedule in the test 
environment. The Functional Manager is to be responsible for controlling and supervising 
backup testing. 
• Restoration procedures must be regularly checked (at least on a Six-monthly basis) and 
tested to ensure that they are effective and that they can be completed within the time 
allotted in the operational procedures for recovery. 
3.5.Backup Frequency 
? The frequency of data backup for each system must be determined by considering the 
‘Availability’ and ‘Integrity’ criteria in accordance with 'Alpha Data’s’ Disaster Recovery 
Plan and Risk Management Methodology. 
3.6.Backup Cycles/Generations 
• At least three generations or cycles of back-up information must be retained for 
important business applications. 
• Additional number of generations or cycles of backup must be determined by considering
the criticality and specific requirements of different systems.
6 | Page Internal Use Version 1 . 0
• Daily and weekly backup media must be stored near the correspondent information 
system site server computer (on-site storage) to be readily available. 
• Backup tapes must be stored periodicity off-site according to data criticality in order to 
be available in the event of a disaster, or for long term storage. 
• At least two copies of fully recoverable version of all critical data must be made. One copy 
must be stored at the Data Center or the main processing facility whereas the other copy 
must be stored at an off-site storage location. 
• Back-up information must be given an appropriate level of physical and environmental 
protection consistent with the standards applied at the Data Center or a main processing 
facility. The controls applied to media at the Data Center or a main processing facility 
must also be implemented at the back-up site. 
3.7.Retention Period 
• Backups of all 'IT & Cloud' data must be retained such that all systems are fully 
recoverable. At a minimum, each backup must be retained for 30 days. 
• The retention period and any requirement for archive copies to be retained for longer 
periods (or permanently) must be formally determined for critical business information 
as well as based on any legal requirements. 
3.8.Backup Documentation 
• Backup documentation must include identification of all critical data, programs, 
documentation, and support items that would be necessary to perform essential tasks 
during a recovery period. 
• Each backup media must be appropriately labeled with details of owner, date, nature of 
backup (e.g. Full image copy or file copy). In addition, it must be given a classification 
label, as applicable, according to 'Alpha Data’s Asset classification and control policy. 
• All backup media to be transported from the Data Center or the processing facility to the 
offsite location must be logged. 
Description 
The on-site backup media log must contain the following information: 
• Date of taking the backup. 
• Date of transporting the media to the offsite location 
• Contents of the media (e.g. transaction backup, application backup, entire system 
backup) 
• Nature of backup (e.g. full image copy or file copy)
